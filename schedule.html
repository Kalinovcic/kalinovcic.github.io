<details id=date-format>
  <summary>Date format</summary>
  <p class="tldr">tldr: <var>2022.11.28</var>, <var>11/28</var>, <var>nov 28</var> etc. or <var>today</var>, <var>tomorrow</var>, <var>sunday</var>, etc.

  <p>When parsing dates, the bot first checks for special named dates. These are, in English: <em>today</em>, <em>tomorrow</em>, <em>yesterday</em>, and in Croatian: <em>danas</em>, <em>sutra</em>, <em>preksutra</em>, <em>jucer</em>, <em>prekjucer</em>. Text is compared case-insensitive.
  <p>After that, named weekdays are checked. In English, <em>mon</em>, <em>tue</em>, <em>wed</em>, <em>thu</em>, <em>fri</em>, <em>sat</em>, <em>sun</em> and the corresponding full names, and in Croatian <em>pon</em>, <em>uto</em>, <em>sri</em>, <em>cet</em>, <em>pet</em>, <em>sub</em>, <em>ned</em> and the corresponding full names. These always refer to the next matching day, not including today. Text is compared case-insensitive.
  <p>If the first token is a number, and the number is between <em>2020</em> and <em>2100</em>, it is interpreted as a year.
  <p>After that, a numeric or named month is expected. Named months are in English only: <em>jan</em>, <em>feb</em>, <em>mar</em>, <em>apr</em>, <em>may</em>, <em>jun</em>, <em>jul</em>, <em>aug</em>, <em>sep</em>, <em>oct</em>, <em>nov</em>, <em>dec</em> and the corresponding full names. Text is compared case-insensitive.
  <p>Finally, after a month comes a numeric date.
  <p>Whitespace characters and separator characters <var>'-'</var>, <var>'/'</var>, <var>':'</var>, <var>'.'</var>, <var>','</var> are ignored.

<details id=time-format>
  <summary>Time format</summary>
  <p class="tldr">tldr: optional date, followed by <var>15</var>, <var>3pm</var>, <var>3.00</var>, <var>3:45</var>, etc.

  <p>When parsing times, there is always an optional leading date. If the date is missing, the implied date is today. See <a href=#date-format>date format</a> for more information about how this is formatted.
  <p>The first part of a time is always the hour, which is initially interpreted as on a 24-hour clock. For convenience, hour 24 is also allowed and interpreted as 0.
  <p>After the hour, there can optionally be minutes, a number between 0 and 59.
  <p>If the time is followed by <em>am</em> or <em>pm</em>, the hour is reinterpreted as on a 12-hour clock. For convenience, hour 0 is also allowed and interpreted as 12.
  <p>Whitespace characters and separator characters <var>'-'</var>, <var>'/'</var>, <var>':'</var>, <var>'.'</var>, <var>','</var> are ignored.
